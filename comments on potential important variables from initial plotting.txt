Variables that appear to have a relationship with TB cases
- urbanisation (exponential), makes sense
- population (linear ish), makes sense on same line with urbanisation
- indigenous (highest numbers with lowest indigenous)
- timeliness


Variables that might have a relationship with TB cases
- Poor sanitation (seems exponential but at end not expected i.e. end with better sanitation)
	also catch it airborne apparently so not sure how sanitation would prevent that which would line up with data
- density
- illiteracy


Variables that dont appear to have a relationship with TB cases
- poverty
- unemployment
- Year


Variables that may be interaction terms
- poverty and density maybe?
- poor sanitation and poverty, strange as seems its higher cases for less poverty and bettter sanitation


Potential model could have population as linear term (or smooth term), and urbanisation and timeliness as smooth terms and 1 or both of the interaction terms and can assess importance from there
